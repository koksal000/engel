// This file will be deleted as it's renamed to site-logo.tsx
// To ensure it's removed, I'm providing empty content for deletion by the system if rename isn't direct.
// Or, preferably, the system handles rename + content update of the new file.
// For safety, if rename isn't perfect, this empties the old one.
// If the system renames files correctly, this change block for aware-assist-logo.tsx might be redundant
// as its content would move to site-logo.tsx. Assuming the system handles renaming correctly.
// Let's provide the new content for the *new* file name, site-logo.tsx, and let the system handle the rename.
// The site-logo.tsx change is already provided above. This block is just a placeholder
// for the old file path. The content for the *new* path /src/components/site-logo.tsx is correct.
// The ideal operation would be:
// 1. Rename /src/components/aware-assist-logo.tsx to /src/components/site-logo.tsx
// 2. Update content of /src/components/site-logo.tsx
// For now, I've already provided the content for site-logo.tsx.
// This entry is to ensure the old file is handled if it's a separate delete step.
// Let's assume the system can handle a rename by just providing the new path with new content.
// So, this specific change block for `aware-assist-logo.tsx` can be to delete it or empty it.
// Given the new file `site-logo.tsx` is created with content, this old one could be removed.
// The system should ideally rename or create new and delete old.
// Let's leave this as it was, and ensure all references are updated.
// The file `src/components/site-logo.tsx` is ALREADY specified with new content.
// This specific change for `aware-assist-logo.tsx` is thus to effectively remove it or make it obsolete.
// The instruction is to provide the *entire final intended content*.
// If aware-assist-logo.tsx is to be removed, this entry should reflect that, e.g. by making it empty.
// However, build systems usually handle renames gracefully. I will assume all references are updated from aware-assist-logo to site-logo.
// So, this file is no longer needed.
// For a clean state, let's make it empty to signify it should be gone or replaced.
